                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    Marine ecosystems defined as the interaction of plants, animals, and the marine
                    environment. By “marine,” we mean of, or produced by, the sea or ocean. The term
                    encompasses the salty waters of the Earth, and is also known simply as a salt water
                    ecosystem. As over 70% of Earth’s surface is covered in water, and 97% of that water
                    is salt water, marine ecosystems are the largest types of ecosystems on the planet.
                    Broadly speaking, the marine ecosystem refers to the oceans and seas and other salt
                    water environments but it can be divided into smaller, distinct ecosystems.
                    In accordance with their large size and wide range, marine ecosystems are also the
                    most diverse of all the ecosystems on the planet. Coral reefs alone are home to over 25%
                    of all marine life, despite occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor.
                    Like all ecosystems, marine ecosystems are finely balanced and highly complex. An ecosystem
                    consist of many different parts, each one has a role in maintaining balance within the system.

                <h1>Basic Marine Ecosystem Facts</h1>
                <h2>Marine Ecosystem Animals </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a great diversity of life with a variety of different habitats.
                    They can be categorized into groups based on where they live (benthic, oceanic, neritic,
                    intertidal),
                    as well as by shared characteristics (vertebrates, invertebrates, plankton).
                    Specific examples of marine animals include sea urchins, clams, jellyfish, corals, anemones, fish,
                    pelicans, dolphins etc.
                </p>
                <h2>Marine Ecosystem Plants </h2>
                <p>
                    Numerous types of plants in a marine ecosystem, including seaweeds, algae (red, green, brown),
                    sea grasses (the only flowering plants in the marine ecosystem), and mangroves.
                </p>
                <h2>Marine Ecosystem Climates </h2>
                <p>
                    Marine ecosystems are found on many different parts of the Earth, so marine climates vary from
                    tropical to polar.
                    Other climates found in marine ecosystems include monsoon, subtropical, temperate, and sub polar.

                <h1>
                    Main Categories of Marine Ecosystems
                </h1>
                <h2>Open Marine Ecosystems </h2>
                <p>The open ocean is a major type of marine ecosystem.
                    This category includes types of sea life that float or swim, such as algae, plankton, jellyfish
                    and whales.
                    Many creatures living in the open ocean inhabit the upper layer of the ocean where the sun’s
                    rays penetrate.
                    This is known as the euphotic zone and extends to a depth of about 150 meters (500 feet).
                </p>
                <h2>Open Floor Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>Marine life exists on the oceans floor as well.
                    Species that live in this ecosystem include certain types of fish, crustaceans, clams, oysters,
                    worms, urchins, seaweed and smaller organisms.
                    In the shallow water, sunlight can penetrate to the bottom.
                    However, at greater depths, sunlight cannot penetrate, and organisms inhabiting this deep water
                    rely on the sinking of organic matter above for survival.
                    Many such organisms are small and generate their own light to find or attract food sources.
                </p>
                <h2>Coral Reef Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>Coral reefs which are among most the productive ecosystems on the planet, are a special subtype
                    of seafloor ecosystem, found only in warm tropical waters and at relatively shallow depths.
                    About one-quarter of marine species depend on coral reefs for food, shelter or both.
                    While coral reefs are famous for attracting brightly colored exotic fish, a plethora of other
                    species snails, sponges and seahorses, to name a few inhabit coral reefs.
                    The reefs themselves are produced by simple animals that build external skeletons around
                    themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>Estuary Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>The term “estuary” typically describes the shallow, sheltered area of a river mouth where
                    freshwater intermingles with saltwater as it enters the sea, although the term can also refer to
                    other areas with flowing brackish waters, such as lagoons or glades.
                    The degree of salinity varies with the tides and the volume of outflow from the river.
                    The organisms inhabiting estuaries are specially adapted to these distinct conditions; hence,
                    the diversity of species tends to be lower than in the open ocean.
                    However, species which generally inhabit neighboring ecosystems may occasionally be found in
                    estuaries.
                    Estuaries also serve an important function as nurseries for many types of fish and shrimp.
                </p>
                <h2>Saltwater Wetland Estuary Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>Found in coastal areas, saltwater wetlands may be considered a special type of estuary, as they
                    also consist of a transition zone between land and sea.
                    These wetlands can be divided into two categories: saltwater swamps and salt marshes.
                    Swamps and marshes differ in that the former are dominated by trees while the latter are
                    dominated by grasses or reeds.
                    Fish, shellfish, amphibians, reptiles and birds may live in or seasonally migrate to wetlands.
                    Additionally, wetlands serve as a protective barrier to inland ecosystems, as they provide a
                    buffer from storm surges.
                </p>
                <h2>Mangrove Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>Some tropical and subtropical coastal areas are home to special types of saltwater swamps known
                    as mangroves.
                    Mangroves may be considered part of shoreline ecosystems or estuary ecosystems.
                    Mangrove swamps are characterized by trees that tolerate a saline environment, whose roots
                    systems extend above the water line to obtain oxygen, presenting a mazelike web.
                    Mangroves host a wide diversity of life, including sponges, shrimp, crabs, jellyfish, fish,
                    birds and even crocodiles.

                    Why Do Marine Ecosystems Need Our Protection And Help?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    According to researches certain fishing practices can harm cold-water coral reefs, for example.
                    That is a problem because the reefs support a variety of living systems including providing
                    a home for young fish. The reefs could also be sources of potential medicines to fight cancer,
                    which is another reason to protect them. Human impacts are ruining the reefs, which are a vital
                    ecosystem for humans and the environment as a whole.
                    The biggest problems are: human beings, carbon-dioxide-driven warming and acidification,
                    overfishing, and use of plastics. Humans drive some problems directly (overfishing), and some are
                    unintentional effects of other issues (burning fossil fuels puts mercury into the air and ends up
                    in seafood which poisoning children). Ultimately all these issues are improved or exacerbated by
                    humans.
