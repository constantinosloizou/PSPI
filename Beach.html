            <h2>Our Action</h2>
            <p>
                At 25 of May at 8 o' clock in the mornig we are organizing a beach cleanup at Ladys Mile in Limassol.
                There is a lot of trash and we are going to collect as many items as possible to make the beach clean again.<br>
                A list of the main items we are going to collect in trash bags:
            </p>
                <li>Plastic bags</li>
                <li>Bottles and cans</li>
                <li>Fishing gear</li>
                <li>Cigarettes</li>
            <p>
                Any more dangerous items like batteries, electronics, broken glass and others will pe placed in containers with screw on lids for our protection.<br>
                All of the volunteers will be splitted in 2 teams. The first team will collect the rubbish and the second
                will sort recycling from the trash. For protection the volunteers will be given protective gloves and it would be good to wear closed-toe shoes
                that are waterpoof. You can also bring your own protective gloves. We recommend you to wear hats and sunglasses in order to protect 
                yourself from the sun.<br>
                <br>
                The benefit from cleaning the beaching will be big. Apart from people who will hang around, a lot of marine animals also
                depend on the beach ecosystem. Also think of the beach as a bridge between the land and marine environment.
                Itâ€™s a critical biodiversity area. Cleaning our beaches is a step towards cleaning our oceans.
