                <p>
                    A forest ecosystem is a community of plants, animals, microbes and all other organisms
                    in interaction with the chemical and physical features of their environment.
                    The organisms involved in a forest ecosystem are interdependent on one another for
                    survival and can be broadly classified as producers, consumers and decomposers.

                <h1>Forest Producers </h1>
                <p>
                    In a forest ecosystem, trees and other plants get their energy from sunlight.
                    Plants produce their own food, in the form of carbohydrates. Plants are, therefore,
                    called the primary producers, since they produce the basic foodstuffs for other organisms
                    within food chains and food webs. Photosynthesis is the chemical reaction that allows
                    plants to produce their own food.
                </p>

                <h1>Forest Consumers</h1>
                <p>
                    All animals, including mammals, insects, and birds, are called consumers.
                    Consumers rely on plants and other animals as a food source. Details of these animals in a
                    forest ecosystem have been given earlier. Primary consumers only eat plants and are
                    referred to as herbivores. Second¬ary consumers are referred to as carnivores and feed on
                    herbivores. Tertiary consumers are carnivores that feed on other carnivores. Omnivores eat both
                    plant and animal matter.
                </p>
                <h1>Forest Decomposers</h1>
                <p>
                    The decomposers of a forest ecosystem break down dead plants and animals, returning the nutrients
                    to the soil to be made usable by the producers. Apart from bacteria, ants and termites are important
                    decomposers in a forest. Millipedes and earthworms also help to break down dead matter.

                <h1>Main Categories of Forest Ecosystems</h1>

                <h2>Tropical Rainforest Ecosystem</h2>
                <p>Tropical rainforests cover the Amazon region, as well as equatorial regions in Africa,
                    Southeast Asia, the east coast of Central America and elsewhere along the equator.
                    These types of forest ecosystem are characterized by broadleaf evergreen trees, vines, tree ferns
                    and palms.
                </p>

                <h2>Tropical Seasonal Forest Ecosystem </h2>
                <p>Located on the edges of rainforests are the tropical seasonal forests that receive dwindling and
                    irregular rainfall.
                    Some of the key parts of a forest in this zone are broadleaf evergreen trees, some deciduous trees
                    and thorn trees.
                    Deciduous trees lose their leaves during the winter.
                </p>

                <h2>Boreal Forest Ecosystem </h2>
                <p>The boreal forest, also known as the needleleaf forest, covers most of the subarctic climate areas
                    located in Canada, Alaska, Siberia, Russia and Europe.
                    Boreal forests are home to many of the plants and animals typically thought of as forest-dwellers,
                    such as foxes, moose, reindeer, bears, squirrels and wolves.
                    Plants like fungi, mosses and lichen do well in the boreal climate, because they are tough enough to
                    survive what can often be extremely cold, icy winters.
                </p>

                <h2>Savannah and Woodland Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>Savanna and woodland ecosystems have a susceptibility to fires and the ability to rejuvenate and
                    re-grow. Prevalent in South America, Africa and Australia,
                    savannas and woodlands are characterized by vast areas of grasslands, bush thickets and clusters of
                    sparse trees with flattened crowns.
                </p>

                <h2>Temperate Evergreen and Deciduous Forest Ecosystem</h2>
                <p> They are called temperate forests because of their weather conditions. Compared to the extreme heat
                    and humidity of a tropical rainforest,
                    temperate evergreen and deciduous forests have moderate climates, with pleasantly warm summers and
                    bearably chilly winters.
                    Found in North America, Europe and Asia, temperate evergreen and deciduous forests tend to blend
                    together at times. Needleleaf and broadleaf trees inhabit the forests.
                    In southern and eastern areas that are fervent with evergreen pines, controlled forest fires still
                    take place as the natural cycle of forest re-growth and enrichment.

                    Known Forest Ecosystems in the World
                </h1>

                <h2>The Amazon Rainforest</h2>
                <p>Located in northern South America and covering an area of 2,300,000 square miles (6 million
                    square kilometres),
                    comprising about 40 percent of Brazil’s total area, the Amazon Rainforest is the world’s richest
                    and most-varied biological reservoir.
                    It contains several million species of insects, plants, birds, and other forms of life, many
                    still unrecorded by science.
                    The luxuriant vegetation encompasses a wide variety of trees, including many species of myrtle,
                    laurel, palm, and acacia,
                    as well as rosewood, Brazil nut, and rubber tree. Excellent timber is furnished by the mahogany
                    and the Amazonian cedar.
                    Major wildlife includes jaguar, manatee, tapir, red deer, capybara and many other types of
                    rodents, and several types of monkeys.
                </p>

                <h2>Congo Basin Rainforest</h2>
                <p>The Congo Rainforest is located in Central Africa and it covers an area of 3.7 million square
                    kilometres.
                    It is known for its high levels of biodiversity, including more than 600 tree species and 10,000
                    animal species.
                    Some of its most famous are forest elephants, gorillas, chimpanzees, okapi, leopards, hippos,
                    and lions.
                    Some of these species have a significant role in shaping the character of their forest home.
                </p>

                <h2>Black Forest</h2>
                <p>Black Forest is a large, forested mountain range in southwest Germany and it covers an area of
                    6000 square kilometres.
                    It's a diverse habitat of grasslands and forests. Spruce and beech trees are common and are
                    important habitats for mosses, lichen, insects, and birds.
                    The largest member of the grouse family, the capercaillie, makes it's home in the southern parts
                    of the Black Forest.
                    Butterflies, like the niobe fritillary and the lesser marbled fritillary, are common to the
                    Black Forest, as are dragonflies—such as the golden ringed dragonfly.
                </p>

                <h2>Tongass National Forest</h2>
                <p>Tongass National Forest is located in Southeast Alaska, it covers an area of 68,000 sqaure kilometres and it's America's 
                    largest national forest.  the Tongass is an island archipelago of countless streams, glacial fjords, and lush valleys backing
                     into spectacularly rugged mountains and sprawling forests of majestic, old-growth cedar, spruce, and hemlock trees.
                      The Tongass also supports abundant fish and wildlife, including all five species of Pacific salmon, brown (grizzly) bears,
                       wolves, Sitka black-tailed deer, Bald Eagles, Northern Goshawks, and Marbled Murrelets.
                </p>

                <h2>Wet Tropics of Queensland</h2>
                <p>The Wet Tropics of Queensland located in Australia cover an area of approximately 8,940 square
                    kilometres of wet tropical forests.
                    The Wet Tropics rainforests are recognised internationally for their ancient ancestry and many
                    unique plants and animals.
                    Many plant and animal species in the Wet Tropics are found nowhere else in the world.
                    The Wet Tropics has the oldest continuously surviving tropical rainforests on earth.

                <h1>The Importance Of Forests </h1>
                <p>Forests cover 30% of the planet’s land surface and they’re fundamental for the quality of the air we breathe,
                     20% of which comes from the Amazonian rainforest. They are also crucial for the quality of the rivers’ waters
                      that cities directly or indirectly consume and for the regulation of the water cycle. They also play a key role
                       in fighting climate change as they soak up and store CO2 into their biomass, preventing it from going to the atmosphere.
                    Furthermore, the fact that tree roots make the soil stronger, forests help minimize the impacts of storms and floods
                     by controlling soil erosion. 80% of the world’s biodiversity can be found in forests. That’s very important because biodiversity
                      enables human developments in areas such as healthcare, pharmaceutics and, more recently, for inspiring the eco-design of products
                       as we learn from nature’s best practices.Not only for the over 1 billion people who live in or close to forests and need it to survive,
                       but also for the ones living in cities and urban areas. We take and transform forests’ raw materials like wood and timber
                        and use them on several commodities from toilet paper, napkins, corks or notebooks to heavier items like tables,
                         chairs or simple wood for burning. How many of us have ever imagined a life without forests? Not only for the over 1 billion people who live in or close to forests and need it to survive,
                     but also for the ones living in cities and urban areas. Hence forests are very important both for people around the world and the environment.
